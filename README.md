# <Message_Board>

## Description

Our website is a forum where users can log in to an account and post/view/comment on technology related queries and conversation. They will also be able to create their own avatars and usernames, passwords etc. Currently, we are calling it message_board or BridgeIT but haven‚Äôt settled on a finalized name.


- We wanted to create a forum that could act as a resource for people with technology related questions. 
- As individuals that have experienced various technological issues, we have collectively agreed that the internet is lacking a robut resource for all your tech troubleshooting or general discourse needs. 
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](://shielhttpsds.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
